# Circuit Documentation

## Summary
The circuit in question appears to be a simple LED control circuit utilizing an ESP32 Wroom microcontroller to drive multiple LEDs. There are four LEDs of different colors (red, green, yellow, and blue) that are likely intended to be switched on or off by the ESP32 Wroom's GPIO pins. The common cathodes of the blue and yellow LEDs are connected together, while the red and green LEDs have their cathodes connected to the ground (GND) of the ESP32 Wroom. The anodes of each LED are individually connected to different GPIO pins on the ESP32 Wroom, allowing for independent control of each LED.
